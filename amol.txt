dsc: WinToUSB is a tool that allows the installation of a Windows operating system from a removable drive such as a pendrive or an external hard drive.With this program, any user can copy the ISO image of the original CD to the external drive to make it the installation source instead of using a physical disc.This program is a great way to keep the Windows installer on a USB so you can have it with you at all times, or run it from computers that no longer have the CD reader. You only have to copy it onto the removable drive and insert it into any computer.
